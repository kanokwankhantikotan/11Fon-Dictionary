Key Considerations and Customization Points for a Real Website:

Jurisdiction: Replace [Singapore] and [Singapore] with the actual legal jurisdiction where your website operates or where you are based. This is crucial for legal enforceability.
Privacy Policy: Always link to a separate, comprehensive Privacy Policy that explains how user data is collected, used, stored, and protected. This is legally required in many jurisdictions (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Specific Features: Tailor the "Description of Service" and "Acceptable Use" sections to reflect any unique features or functionalities of your dictionary website (e.g., interactive games, forums, user contributions, premium subscriptions).
Monetization: If your website uses advertising, affiliate links, or offers premium services, you'll need to add clauses addressing these.
DMCA/Copyright Infringement: If your site allows user-generated content, you should include a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice and takedown policy.
Age Restrictions: If your content is not suitable for all ages, you might need to include age restrictions.
Disclaimer Specifics: You may want to add more specific disclaimers regarding the nature of dictionary data (e.g., "While we strive for accuracy, language is constantly evolving, and definitions may vary").
Legal Counsel: This sample is for informational purposes only. It is strongly recommended to consult with a legal professional to draft a Terms of Service that is specifically tailored to your website and complies with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
